# CodSoft Company Remote Internship Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic projects completed during my remote internship at CodSoft Company. The projects are implemented using Python and PyQt5 for creating calculators, the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and a password generator.

## Projects

### Calculator (PyQt5)

- A simple calculator application built using PyQt5.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Allows for clearing the input and displaying the result.

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

- A classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python.
- Play against the computer and try to win by selecting rock, paper, or scissors.
- Display the result of each round and keep track of the score.

### Password Generator

- A Python script to generate strong and random passwords.
- Customize the password length and choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.
